# ExpenseTracker

## What is does
1. This is a website where you can track your transactions based on income, expense, debt and receivable money. 
2. You just need to log in and then add the transaction amount, choose a type of transaction and add a description. Your transaction will be created. 
3. If you select debt or receivable transaction type you can later mark the transaction if you've given or gotten the money and it will update the total amount.
